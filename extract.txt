List of all possible names for shares outstanding:
    CommonStockSharesOutstanding
    EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding

Decide if to ping individual concepts instead of getting all the data
Alternative is storing all the files in harddisk instead of memory
    The Current strategy is to store the data using pickle and reload it for analysis

Three things:
    First:
        Graph and correlate measures and ratios
            Currently forward filling fundamentals data, could be fucked in the future
            Include the rate of change of the variables and compare those 
    Second:
        Make a test to validate trading strategies
            Add a function that picks eligible stocks at some timeframe and test their performance xdz
    Third:
        Train a model to predict the long term price
            forward filling fundamentals can be really fucked 
            Consider using averages or linear change from previous value to next for training 
            Include all the past fundamentals for each datapoint - this could figure out how people value growth.

Data to add for regression and AI:
    oil price
    interest rates 
        FRED HAS SO MUCH DATA HOLY SHIT 
        pick yer fucking poison mate
    

Measures:
    Price/BookValuepershare = MarketCap/BookValue = EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding*SPrice(Assets-Liabilities)
    Price/Earnings - all the possible earnings metrics
    Current ratio = AssetsCurrent/LiabilitiesCurrent

    Revenue
    Operating Income 
    Free cash flow 
    EBITDA 
    Dividends - "PaymentsOfDividendsCommonStock"

How does market cap influence these correlations?

Where do you find price data?
    Yahoo-fin.


Methods to figure out relationships:
    Kendall's Tau
    Spearman's Rank Correlation

    cross variable correlation loop through all variables 
    Polynomial regression
    LSTM

Alternatively you can use the frames api to get the data if it all goes to hell

Todo:
    Maybe split the price part into a second async price_init
        async is fucking up again

    Implement replacement logic 
        if not enough try additive, but its fucked 

    Shares is now identical to fact, you can join them together

    Sleeps are clogging up the semaphore
