We use three different models:
    Static:
        - We need to make sure the predictions are always bounded so that we only skip one report
        - 

    Dynamic:
        - Used to having a report in the middle of the range, 1 month cushion then range up to 4 months
        - 
    Indicators:
        - We predict the price in 1 month
        - This our short term part 
        - 
Together:
    Our dynamic serves as a long term predictor, static is medium and indicator short term
    We figure out how to plug them together and train them together 



The price is predicted as the 80th percentile of the price of some interval around the predicting date
